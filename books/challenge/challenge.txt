Assignment: Books
Objectives:
Practice designing ERDs with many-to-many relationships.
Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks authors, books, and author's favorite books.

Each book should have an id, title, and each author should be able to save a list of their favorite books. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this database.

Create a new model (ERD)

Name the schema books_schema

Create a table called authors

Add the following fields to the authors table: id, name, created_at and updated_at

Create a table called books

Add the following fields to the books table: id, title, num_of_pages, created_at, and updated_at

Create a many to many relationship between authors and books and rename the joining table to favorites

Change the field names to the singular pronoun. ie. author_id and book_id
